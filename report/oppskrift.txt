3a) Discretize the diff. equations and set up an algortim for solving these equations using Euler and Velocity Verlet.  Done.

3b) Write a program for solving the diff. equations in a Earth-Sun system. Done.

3c) Find initial velocity which gives circular orbit and test stability of algorithm as function of different time steps delta t. Must plot and compare.
Make a plot of the results you obtain for the position of the Earth orbiting the Sun. See above.
Check that kinetic and potential energies are conserved. Done.
Discuss eventual differences between Verlet and Euler.
Consider number of FLOPs involved and perform a timing of the two algorithms for equal final times. Timing: done. FLOPs: As soon as we have written down the algo.

3d) Find by trial and error what the initial velocity must be in order for the planet to escape from the sun. Find exact answer? Match numericals? Have to do trial and error. Exact found.

3e)Aim is to find how much Jupiter alters the Earth's motion. Done.
Modify your diff. equations to accomadate both the motion of the Earth and Jupiter. Done.
Plot pos of Earth and Jupiter using Verlet. Discuss the stability of the solutions using your Verlet solver. Plot and discuss, test for different dt.
Inrease the mass of Jupiter by a factor of 10 and 1000 and plot the position of the Earth. Study the stability of the Verlet solver. Have to do.

3f) Set center of mass as origio.
Give Sun initial velocity that makes the total momentum of the system exactely zero. Done.
Compare these results with those from the previous exercise and comment your results. Add a new task in program.
Extend your program to include all planets in the solar system and discuss your results. Use the NASA link for initial positions and velocities for all planets. Done.

3g) Add general relativity correction to gravitational force. Run simulation over one century of Mercury's orbit around the Sun. Check the value of the perihelion angle theta_p using formula. Make sure time resolution is sufficient. Can the observed perihelion precession of Mercury be explained by the general theory of relativity. Done.

Want to add:


Latex:
- Add forward Euler algorithm. Count FLOPs.
- Write about energies conserved.
- Discussion: Write about Euler vs. Verlet or write it in theory or both.
- Show trial and error in results.
- Theory: How to add more planets.
- Results: Write about the Sun's initial velocity
- Explain that the program sometimes start writing one point early.  

To do that is not Latex:
- Make a good plotscript. Simen
- Plot and compare (test stability) the Earth-Sun system.
- Plot trial and error.
- Plot position of Earth and Jupiter with Sun in origo for different dt.
- Increase mass of Jupiter and plot position. Study stability.
- Add a new task in program for ESJ with centre-of-mass in origo.  Simen.
